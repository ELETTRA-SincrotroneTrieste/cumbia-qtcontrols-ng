 The new generation of {\itshape cumbia controls} focuses on the design of {\itshape high level software}, offering components for custom-\/tailored data visualization as well as for synoptic applications

Circular plots draw curves along a circular x axis and a radial y axis. A \doxyref{Qu\+Circular\+Plot\+Engine}{p.}{classQuCircularPlotEngine} is used to store plot data and draw its contents. The engine is common to both QWidget based and QGraphics\+Item based implementations, namely Qu\+Circular\+Plot\+Widget and Qu\+Circular\+Plot\+Item. According to the nature of your application and the preferred technology, both provide identical behaviour through \doxyref{Qu\+Circular\+Plot\+Engine}{p.}{classQuCircularPlotEngine}. \doxyref{Qu\+Circular\+Plot\+Engine}{p.}{classQuCircularPlotEngine} is itself a QObject rich in methods, signals and slots. \doxyref{Qu\+Circular\+Plot\+Engine}{p.}{classQuCircularPlotEngine} stores the options of the plots (axis autoscale, bounds, colors) through a dedicated structure named \doxyref{qucircularplot\+\_\+attributes}{p.}{structqucircularplot__attributes}. \doxyref{Qu\+Circular\+Plot\+Curve}{p.}{classQuCircularPlotCurve} represents a curve in the plot. There can be several curves in a single plot. Each curve is identified by a name.
